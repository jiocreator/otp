1
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,360
There are many types of lusts in this world,

2
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:53,039
but the most fatal type is the one in which
both participants consider love till the end.

3
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,360
God is great.

4
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,000
Mahi.

5
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,639
Nooray, you people leave,

6
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:54,000
you inform Shah Jee that we have left,
we will call him when we get to Lahore.

7
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,119
Yes madam.

8
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:58,400
Once the trains comes,
we will leave too.

9
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,159
If you need anything else madam,
I will send it.

10
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:03,720
No you people leave.

11
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,400
Yes.

12
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:07,959
I will come.

13
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:10,720
What are you doing?

14
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,039
Look at that.

15
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,439
They have not left?

16
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,000
No, they are still…
Oh, its here.

17
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,079
What do you mean?

18
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:55,239
When someone comes late in the afternoon,
they won’t even get lunch?

19
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,280
Do you have some shame?

20
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,600
Tell me, where were you since morning?
Where have you been roaming?

21
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,920
Do you not care about your father’s old age?

22
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,319
That’s it, your emotional drama has started?

23
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,680
Yes, it has started.

24
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:11,039
No one says anything to you,
you do whatever you want with us.

25
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,639
He talks nonsense.

26
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,079
Fari.

27
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,839
Fari, please give me something to eat,

28
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,519
I am really hungry,
I swear I am starving.

29
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,920
Papa is here.

30
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,200
Your father is here, don’t say a word.
You have to stay quiet, you hear that?

31
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,560
I never say anything.

32
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,400
Be quiet.

33
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,280
Hello papa.

34
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,319
Hello.

35
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,000
Give it to me, I will keep it.

36
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,560
Hello papa.

37
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,039
Hello.

38
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,680
I am surprised,
you too are at home today?

39
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,680
Huh?

40
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,479
How are your exams going?

41
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,759
Did you prepare well?

42
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,360
I have worked really hard this time papa,

43
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,000
I have given all the exams till now
with a lot of preparation.

44
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,280
Yes, brother always prepares well,
the results comes out bad.

45
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,560
Shut your nonsense, okay?

46
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,680
I don’t have any high hopes from him.

47
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:21,200
Once he passes his BA,

48
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:27,039
I will get him a job as a clerk in my office,
what else can he do?

49
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,119
Did Sajjad call?

50
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,959
He had an interview in
the public service commission today.

51
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes, the sister talked to him after the interview,

52
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,079
he was really happy and saying that
he will get the job by the will of God.

53
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,639
Yes, if God wills.
If God wills. Why not?

54
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,800
I only have hopes from my eldest son,

55
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,200
by the will of God he will do something good.

56
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,239
I will go check food.

57
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,400
Okay.

58
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:24,439
You are back.

59
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,519
Do you not have any work at home
apart from hanging around here?

60
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,800
What happened?
Why are you in a bad mood?

61
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,280
I feel uncle again…

62
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,479
Yes, make fun.

63
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,680
You too make fun.

64
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,400
No problem.

65
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,759
One day when I will become an affluent person,

66
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:47,519
you along with my father
will remain standing here.

67
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,879
God knows when that day will come,

68
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,079
It will take such a long time.

69
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,519
Go from here. Leave.

70
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,759
Why should I leave?

71
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,839
Its your time to leave.

72
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,720
This time your father will not
be able to tolerate your any failure.

73
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,039
Nothing like that will happen,
I am properly prepared this time.

74
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,759
Oh God, you will cheat.

75
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,119
Its really sad Feedi,

76
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,759
learn something from brother Sajjad.

77
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,560
Listen to me,
don’t give me these lectures.

78
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,519
Now leave from here,
I have to take out some important questions today.

79
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,039
Okay do call me,

80
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,560
I will help you in making
the cheating material.

81
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,159
Neighbors comes to rescue in hard times.

82
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:51,200
Brother, I think we will get late,
I also have to get the train to Lahore.

83
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,439
I don’t understand this adventure of yours,

84
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:59,560
Lahore is not even a forty minute flight,
but you need to waste your time in trains.

85
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,280
You feudal lords won’t understand
the romanticism of the train.

86
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,879
Do read “Orient Express” by Aghata Christie once,

87
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,159
then you too will be seen traveling in a train.

88
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,200
Leave it,

89
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,839
let me stay away from all this.

90
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
I already have enough
responsibilities of the home,

91
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,319
so this romanticism has no place in my life,

92
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:21,639
I will go pay my respect.

93
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,119
Try to come soon.

94
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,239
You are Sajawal’s son, right?

95
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,119
Yes.

96
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,200
What do you want old man?

97
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,079
What can you give?

98
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,759
If you want something, ask me.

99
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,360
I don’t want anything, I have everything.

100
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,879
No one has everything.

101
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,479
Something always lacks.

102
00:10:58,119 --> 00:10:58,920
Really?

103
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:02,479
Then, please pray that
the train to Lahore gets late,

104
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,239
because brother is inside and
I think he will get me late.

105
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,720
If you miss the train, then let it happen.

106
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,879
Don’t travel today

107
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:16,200
or else you will lose everything,
whatever that you have and…

108
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,639
Hey, no, no

109
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,639
I am going to Lahore for a really important meeting,
if I don’t go everything will go wrong.

110
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,239
Everything will go wrong anyway.

111
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,639
Okay, it’s up to you,
if you want it like that.

112
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,759
From today your journey will begin,

113
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:46,119
no one knows where it will end.

114
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:48,800
No one knows.

115
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:16,200
What happened?

116
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:17,000
Shall we go?

117
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,959
You are back! Let’s go.

118
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,039
Where are you going
so late at night, brother?

119
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:37,720
If papa finds out,
you will get scolded badly.

120
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:39,280
And you have your exam in the morning too.

121
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:40,680
It’s necessary for me to go,

122
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,680
if he asks where I am, please handle it.

123
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,119
I will be back soon.

124
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,959
Brother, will you get us killed?

125
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:51,759
You know papa regularly comes once
at night to check on brother Sajjad.

126
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:55,519
Man, Feedi, she is right, it is really late,
you go in the morning.

127
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,239
Why don’t you people understand?

128
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,280
It’s necessary for me to go,
if I don’t go, everything will go wrong.

129
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:03,000
You people please handle it.

130
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,600
Brother…

131
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,720
Sajjad lock the door before you sleep.

132
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,400
Where is Fariha?

133
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,039
Papa…you?

134
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:30,000
What are you doing here?

135
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,800
Your mother is calling you downstairs, go.

136
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,400
Yes papa, I was going downstairs.

137
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,519
Yes, go.

138
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,920
Look at this,

139
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,039
this lazy man is still sleeping.

140
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:43,959
Wake him up,
he has an exam in the morning,

141
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:47,000
he is dreaming away.

142
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,600
Hey, Farhad.

143
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:49,879
Farhad.

144
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,200
Papa. Papa. Your medication.

145
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,479
I forgot to give it to you on my way up,
so I thought I would bring it.

146
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,759
You missed it yesterday, have it.

147
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,959
Or else you will get unwell.

148
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:02,400
I think your mother was calling Fariha for this.

149
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,039
Papa, you go I will come,

150
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:08,519
brother Farhad told us to wake him up at 12,
I will get fresh and study.

151
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,360
Its 12.

152
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,600
Wake him.

153
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,319
Wake him up, man!

154
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,159
He is still sleeping.

155
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,879
Yes, we are waking him.

156
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,600
Hey, Feedi, you almost got us killed today.

157
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,519
Hey, hero.

158
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:13,479
Where is Feedi, man?

159
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:17,079
That man must be coming too, 
Babu Booti.

160
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,400
Not Babu Booti, its Baba Booti.
At least take his name correctly, idiot.

161
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,360
Hey don’t correct me when I am worried.

162
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,639
This is the limit.

163
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,239
Hey, Baba Booti is here on his ride.

164
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:31,479
But man, he looks like a private
detective from an old English movie.

165
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:35,360
Come on.

166
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,400
Come on.

167
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,560
Where is Feedi?
I told him to come sharp at 12.

168
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,920
He must be on his way.

169
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,920
Look, I cannot stay here,
it’s really dangerous.

170
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,959
I have come secretly,

171
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:56,039
the board people have put spies after me.

172
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,119
Give me the money and
keep your cheating material.

173
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:00,839
Feedi has the money.

174
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,360
Damn it.

175
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,839
Police.

176
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,000
Raid.

177
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:14,239
Hey, I am dead.

178
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:15,319
I will be dead.

179
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:19,200
Come on. Move it.
Come on. Come on. Move it.

180
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,879
Okay Mr. Policeman,

181
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:35,319
we will meet soon,
take care of yourself.

182
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,800
Okay Mr. Inspector we will meet soon.

183
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,839
Remember what I told you.

184
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:41,959
Yes sir.

185
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,800
I will do it this time,
there is pressure from papa.

186
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,600
Next time I will surely study
and give the exam.

187
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,400
Yes fine, come on.

188
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,239
Okay, bye.

189
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,280
What happened?

190
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,879
Feedi, what is this drama?

191
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:04,039
What was this?

192
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:05,920
What happened?

193
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:08,119
The SHO was from the same locality,

194
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,639
he gave me a lift till here,
so what happened?

195
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,200
What was the SHO saying?

196
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,680
Nothing,

197
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,920
after all, we are really late,
we also need to get the guide too.

198
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,119
Where is he right now?

199
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,319
There he is. Come on.

200
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,479
Hey, hold my hand. Hold my hand.

201
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,639
Sister in law.

202
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,680
Sister in law,
can we go eat ice cream, please?

203
00:17:54,879 --> 00:17:56,639
Not right now. Are you mad?
We will go in a little while.

204
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,839
Where is uncle?
I don’t see uncle, anywhere.

205
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,000
Bring it son, bring it, keep it here.

206
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,360
Careful brother.
See if we left anything.

207
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,839
There is nothing inside,
everything is here.

208
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,239
The black bag must be inside too, bring it.

209
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:11,400
Madam, everything is here, don’t worry.

210
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,039
How do I not worry, brother?
It’s my bag.

211
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:17,319
Sister in law it has my…
it has my jewelry.

212
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,879
Sister in law, I am telling you,
if he steals that I will choke him to death.

213
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,560
Listen, I will ruin you,

214
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:28,119
where did you keep my black bag,
tell me right now. I want it.

215
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,039
Calm down Maheen, we will find it.

216
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:31,519
Okay, if we don’t find it,

217
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,800
you will book me a flight right now
and I will go back.

218
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,119
Because what will I do without the bag?

219
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:39,319
Madam, maybe it’s inside,
I will just go now and look.

220
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,519
Wait, stop.

221
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:43,920
You think I am an idiot
that I let you go inside,

222
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,879
and then I wont get my bag or you!

223
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,479
Brother, you please send someone else
and get the things checked.

224
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,360
Hey Shaukay.

225
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:54,039
Shaukay come here.

226
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:58,800
Go and check in compartment five,
madam’s small suitcase is there, go see it.

227
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,600
Come soon.

228
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,920
You know you are an irresponsible porter,

229
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:07,800
in such a big train,
in so many compartments,

230
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,439
you only had to lose
my black bag in all these bags.

231
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,239
There is no bag inside.

232
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:23,600
You look for it yourself.

233
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:24,759
What?

234
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,680
Hey you picked the bag in front of my eyes,

235
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,839
how can it go anywhere?

236
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:31,879
Maheen, madam,

237
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:35,639
look at that, it looks like your bag,
it’s yours right?

238
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,720
It doesn’t look like my bag,
it is my bag.

239
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,879
Maheen.

240
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,159
Maheen.

241
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,280
Hey, listen. Stop. Give my bag.

242
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,519
This is what they call, face of a believer,
but actions of a sinner.

243
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,319
Are you not ashamed of
stealing someone’s bag?

244
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:50,079
Give it back.

245
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,519
What? What do you want?

246
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,400
My bag that you stole.

247
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:59,720
This is our luggage but this…

248
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:02,319
Yes, this is mine.

249
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,639
The thief gets caught in the end.

250
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,239
Actually, this is our luggage,
but I am sure you are mistaken.

251
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:18,000
Do you think my bag has feet,
that walked with your luggage?

252
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:20,479
Are you not ashamed?

253
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,479
You don’t look like a thief…
Maheen…

254
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:25,000
I should hand you over to the police
then you will speak the truth.

255
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,879
Ma’am, you are getting upset for no reason,
these bags can get exchanged by mistake.

256
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,039
That’s it.

257
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,959
This the excuse a thief makes
when they get caught.

258
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:39,600
I have no fault in all this, you know,
I think the porter made a mistake.

259
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,479
I am letting you go right now
because I don’t have time.

260
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,200
If I had time, I would have
handed you over to the police.

261
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,239
He is a thief, it had all my jewelry in it.

262
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,920
The way I am finding these pages,

263
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,800
I hope I find the answers to
the questions too, it will be great.

264
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:37,360
Please help me pass this time.
In the name of God…

265
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,560
Fari,

266
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,720
boil six eggs,

267
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,159
I am coming down.

268
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,879
What is all this that you are doing brother?

269
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:37,000
Can you not see,
I am preparing for my exam.

270
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:40,439
What have you done to papa’s coat?

271
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,400
He doesn’t even use it now.

272
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,759
This is the limit brother.

273
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,600
Mama is thinking that her beloved son

274
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,360
is wearing his father’s coat to get
blessings out of his father’s love

275
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,639
but you have filled it with cheating material.

276
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:55,560
Little one,

277
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,439
don’t act like my aunt.

278
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:01,200
Now come on, leave from here,

279
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:04,800
before Mughal e Azam comes looking for you,
and sees all this.

280
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,360
Come on, leave from here.

281
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,519
Out. out. out.

282
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,000
Brother, if you had finally got the paper,
you should have memorized five questions.

283
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:12,560
Memorized it!

284
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,639
Did I do all this hard
work to memorize all this.

285
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:19,759
Come on, little one.

286
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,000
Come on before he comes.

287
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:24,759
Little one, leave.

288
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,600
This is left.

289
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,439
Feedi.

290
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,759
Oh God,

291
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,159
this boy is weird,

292
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,079
he never gives me his dirty clothes to wash,
I wash all the clothes daily, but no.

293
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:10,200
Oh God, he has done the same thing inside.

294
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:12,400
This is the limit. I am tired.

295
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:15,159
When their wives come they will get fine.

296
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:20,159
I am tired of this boy,
he has created a mess.

297
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:27,959
I will wash these,
rest I will check later what is this trouble.

298
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:49,600
This is Seth Nisar’s mansion, right?

299
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,039
Yes, this is the mansion.

300
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,680
Okay,

301
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:55,759
Mr. Nisar is the same one
who has a cement factory in Okara, right?

302
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:59,360
No sir, he does import export,
he has his own gardens and lands.

303
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,680
Okay, okay,

304
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:03,720
actually I am new in the city,

305
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:06,959
no one knows each other,
it’s so hard to find his address.

306
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:08,639
Sir, don’t you have his mobile number?

307
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:11,560
Brother, I made a mistake.

308
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,200
I don’t know
where I missed his mobile number.

309
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,200
Do you have an event at your home?

310
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:22,920
Yes, yes,

311
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:26,239
Mr. Nisar’s daughter is getting married in a few days,
we are preparing for that.

312
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:27,319
Okay. Okay.

313
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:29,360
May God give her a good future.

314
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,239
I am sorry I bothered you people,

315
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:34,920
I think I have come to the next lane,
I will go check in the next lane.

316
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:35,879
Thank you.

317
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,400
Yes, alright.

318
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,079
Fari,

319
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,159
hurry up, its really late,

320
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:54,759
I have to get to the office.

321
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,319
I am coming brother.

322
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,119
Let’s go.

323
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,000
Come on.

324
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:19,079
Mama.

325
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,039
Mama.

326
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,360
Hey, you didn’t leave,
you had your exam today.

327
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,280
Yes, yes, I am preparing to leave for that,
I have my exam at 2 pm.

328
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:28,800
I kept papa’s brown coat there,
I cannot find it anywhere, come on, find it for me.

329
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,680
Hey, what is wrong with you?
Will you make me fall?

330
00:26:30,879 --> 00:26:33,360
Have you gone mad?
You look like a joker in your father’s coat.

331
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,400
You don’t know, I have to do a lot right now,
I have to go prepare the desk in the hall.

332
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,039
Come on, help me find it.

333
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:41,920
Hey, what coat?
The same one, that is torn?

334
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:42,959
Yes, that one.

335
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:44,839
The one that doesn’t have
two buttons in the sleeve.

336
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,439
I just washed it,

337
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:48,119
I thought when it dries,

338
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,319
I will give it to the hawker and get plates and glasses,
there are no utensils at home.

339
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:58,119
You washed it?

340
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,039
Yes, I washed it.

341
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,680
What did you do, mama?

342
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:08,280
Oh God, mama my whole course was in it,
why did you wash it?

343
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,039
What is wrong with him?
He is saying weird things.

344
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:15,879
Fine, it will dry in an hour,
then wear it in the evening.

345
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,239
I am disappointed,

346
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:51,200
I think all your efforts for
the exams have gone to waste.

347
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,959
No need to be sarcastic.

348
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:57,920
I know how sorry and disappointed you,

349
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,360
jealous girl.

350
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,319
Why would I be jealous?

351
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:06,800
After all, would you have gotten
a gold medal in the locality in BA?

352
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,159
Getting a gold medal is nothing great

353
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,560
and you will see all these people
who get gold medals will work for me,

354
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:16,800
this is how you poor people think.

355
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:18,280
Poor people.

356
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:19,720
Poor people?

357
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,239
Yes, we are poor, you are affluent people,
you have a lot of factories.

358
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,720
These factories and these big salaries
are the problem of you poor people.

359
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:37,839
I don’t know what was that bad day
that you people came as our neighbors?

360
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,920
I have been hearing since childhood,

361
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,479
that Mr. Ramzan is building his home,
he is building his home,

362
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,319
make it already and leave from here.

363
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:45,600
Why do we leave? You leave.

364
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:49,039
There is not long before the clock strikes 2.

365
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,280
You wasted my time,

366
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:56,639
I have to buy the guide on the way.

367
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,519
Okay listen, go carefully,

368
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,360
this country and nation needs
young people like you.

369
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:07,159
I will teach you a lesson…

370
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:13,839
She is after me.

371
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,759
Saeen, they are a family from Bahawalpur,

372
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:18,439
they are staying at some Seth Nisar’s home,

373
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:20,400
they have their mansion in Defence.

374
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:23,280
It’s wedding of Seth’s daughter’s,

375
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,600
women from Bahawalpur
have come as guests.

376
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,159
Really?

377
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:32,239
Then it is easy to find out about her,

378
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,680
Bahawalpur is not that far from us.

379
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:36,000
Yes master,

380
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:37,879
what is the order for me now?

381
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:44,159
After the wedding,
they will surely go back to Bahawalpur,

382
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,360
Essa, you have to keep
your eyes on them secretly.

383
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:51,879
If you want, you can call two to four
more people from the locality for this work.

384
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:53,280
Yes, master.

385
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,159
Okay Essa,

386
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,879
brother Sikandar shouldn’t find out,

387
00:29:58,439 --> 00:29:59,400
be careful.

388
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,000
You don’t worry,

389
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,519
he will not find out

390
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
and your work will be done too.

391
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,319
Perfect.

392
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,680
A thief has getting caught in his fate.

393
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:35,680
Go Bushra,
see the arrangement in the kitchen.

394
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,439
See papa,

395
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:44,159
she has just come here and
she is talking about leaving.

396
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:46,439
Thank God that I came.

397
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,119
If uncle hadn’t called
and insisted again and again,

398
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:51,680
it would have been impossible for me
and sister in law to come here like this.

399
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,280
You know, I have complaints with brother Kazim,

400
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:56,479
I am upset with him, why didn’t he come?

401
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:59,920
Aunty, he would have surely come,
at the last moment him and Shah Jee,

402
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:02,239
got busy with the case of an old land

403
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:04,639
and you know that appearing
before the court is important.

404
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:08,400
Okay, you people are here,
we have to have a lot of fun together.

405
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,479
Hey aunty, you don’t worry about fun,

406
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,079
you just warn your neighbors
to have their headphones ready

407
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,119
because there will be a lot
of noise in this home of yours.

408
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:19,600
A lot of noise!

409
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,639
Hey, where are you lost?

410
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,119
I have been waiting for you for an hour.

411
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,920
Yes, speak up, I am listening.

412
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,600
You can listen to us on the phone too,

413
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,000
what is the point of coming here?

414
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,280
So far.

415
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:43,360
I can bet and tell you he is here,
but his attention is not here.

416
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,680
Whether you agree or not,

417
00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:47,039
he is still thinking about her,

418
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,479
did the train journey, start your love story?

419
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,560
Did my brother fall in love with someone?

420
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:56,039
Are you guys done?

421
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,800
Please make a plan.

422
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,319
Then come on, lets do something.

423
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,200
And what about you
people watching TV for so long,

424
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,920
and I was waiting for you.
What about that?

425
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,800
Hey, check it out,

426
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:42,039
they have so much peace on their face,

427
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:44,479
where do they get so much peace from?

428
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,239
I will die,

429
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:49,920
my father will kill me if I fail this time too.

430
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,400
I heard it and died.

431
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,479
Feedi, I didn’t prepare because of you,
I wish I had not listened to you.

432
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,119
You people are useless, 
I had told you people to prepare a little,

433
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:01,759
if nothing else, you should have kept
the guide in your shirt or trouser.

434
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,000
Now all of you die.

435
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,000
What will we do now?

436
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,400
What now? Go home quietly.

437
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,639
Yes, go home. You are right.

438
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:11,200
There is still an hour and
thirty minutes for the exam to end,

439
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:13,039
what will you say when you go home?

440
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,319
My love, no one will let us sit here.

441
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,439
Okay wait, I have an idea.

442
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:20,479
What?

443
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:21,200
Come on.

444
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,680
Come on. Come Feedi.
Hey come. Come.

445
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,360
I have told Nisar to keep all
the wedding functions in the lawn,

446
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,720
I don’t like guests who enter your rooms…

447
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:36,280
Bushra, why are you keeping the sweets here?

448
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:38,159
Go keep it in the kitchen.

449
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,560
This is the limit Bushra.

450
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,439
Getting these servant to work
will give me blood pressure.

451
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,280
What do I do? I don’t understand.

452
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:48,280
Hey, Bushra.

453
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:51,600
Bushra, go outside
and see the kid will fall.

454
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,839
Oh God. Go fast.

455
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:01,439
These servants will drive me mad,
I pray that the wedding goes smoothly, somehow.

456
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,920
By the will of God.

457
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,360
Has she reached or not?

458
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,239
Sister in law.

459
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,680
Fakeera.

460
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:10,879
Sister in law.

461
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:12,959
Yes Mahi, I am here.

462
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,119
Sister in law,
I have looked through all my things,

463
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:22,479
but I cannot find my blue scarf.

464
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,680
Blue?

465
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:28,879
I had asked Fakeera to keep it myself.
Check properly, it must be there.

466
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:32,600
I have seen it ten times in all my things,
its not there.

467
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,759
Now tell me, what will I wear on the musical night,
I want to wear that blue dress, that’s it.

468
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,680
Fakeera.

469
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:44,560
Fakeera.

470
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:45,600
Yes?

471
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,519
Did you keep my blue dress in my luggage?

472
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,519
Madam Mahi, madam had me
working on other things.

473
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,439
I was stitching the clothes,

474
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,239
she has sent fifty two dresses for madam Rida.

475
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,239
Fifty two dresses.

476
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:06,439
And your work after all
was being done by Asghari.

477
00:35:06,879 --> 00:35:10,200
See sister in law, see,
she has ruined my celebration.

478
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,479
That’s it, its decided,

479
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:15,360
I will not sit in Rida’s musical night.

480
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,039
Oh Rida, what is wrong?

481
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,200
You have started creating
a scene as soon as you came.

482
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,920
Aunty, this always happens with me,
she has left half my clothes back.

483
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,519
Hey, you got so many clothes,
wear anything, why are you getting upset.

484
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:29,839
No,

485
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:33,959
I want to wear the same blue dress,
the scarf of which she left at home.

486
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:40,680
No problem,
you wear the scarf of my blue dress,

487
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:42,959
it matches your suit anyway.

488
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,319
You have not stopped being stubborn.

489
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,519
You are my friend, right?
You know about me, right?

490
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,560
When I think about something,
I don’t like if anything happens against it.

491
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,680
Mahi.

492
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:03,039
Mahi.

493
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,519
Mahi.

494
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,439
What is wrong, Mahi?

495
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,560
Why are you sad?

496
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:20,879
Okay, come on, get up.

497
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,479
We will go to the market
and get you a new scarf, okay?

498
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,119
Mahi, we will find it, come on, at least.

499
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:36,800
We will not find it.

500
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:39,720
It was an exact match.

501
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:43,039
I am telling you we will find it.

502
00:36:43,479 --> 00:36:45,800
Come on, get up. Come on.

503
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,800
We will go.

504
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:55,759
Okay.

505
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,720
Fari.

506
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,439
Fari.

507
00:38:44,879 --> 00:38:45,839
Yes, papa?

508
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:52,119
Hey, I cannot find my blue colored file.
See if it is in the room.

509
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,319
Yes papa.

510
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:57,839
Hey brother Farhad, you are back.

511
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,200
You have a long life,
papa was just asking about you.

512
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,639
Its good he is back, come on,
quickly cook bread, he must be hungry too.

513
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:07,200
Yes mama.

514
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:13,560
Hello papa.

515
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:15,319
Hello.

516
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:19,360
Sit with us some time
and discuss something.

517
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,600
Come, sit.

518
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:27,200
How are your exams going?

519
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,079
Fine?

520
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,360
Look, I will not take anything less
than first division,

521
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:34,360
I need it at all cost.

522
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:37,519
Fine you are not as smart as your brother,

523
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,560
but you are the son of government superintendent,
Taufeeq Ahmad’s son,

524
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,439
so we need the first division.

525
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,159
Yes papa, I hope so, you pray.

526
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,239
Only prayers don’t help,

527
00:39:50,759 --> 00:39:53,319
you have to work hard with all your heart.

528
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,239
Now there are two positions
open in my office for junior clerk,

529
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:00,839
I am thinking you pass your BA,

530
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:05,319
I will talk to them and request them
that I have worked there for thirty years,

531
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:06,959
they will care for that at least.

532
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:09,759
So I will get you a job in my office.

533
00:40:10,439 --> 00:40:12,479
This will be good,

534
00:40:12,879 --> 00:40:15,159
my son will be a big officer too.

535
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,720
You son, prepare hard for your CSS.

536
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,159
When you clear your CSS
my difficulties will be eased too.

537
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:29,039
Papa, why do you worry?

538
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:32,439
My preparation is complete,
I will fulfill your wish by the will of God.

539
00:40:32,879 --> 00:40:34,439
Live long, live happy.

540
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:37,759
When you do your CSS,
a lot of my burden will be reduced.

541
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:39,280
Yes, by the will of God.

542
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,079
Serve food now.

543
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:48,519
Your beloved is here after wasting the day.

544
00:40:51,439 --> 00:40:53,159
Yes, I am serving it.

545
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,119
Turn it on, turn on Geo for the news.

546
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,000
Yes.

547
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:44,039
Mrs. Arfah, who is this girl?
She has made the whole celebration lively.

548
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,680
Oh, your brother Nisar,
his best friend, Kazim Shah’s daughter.

549
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,959
She is Rida’s childhood friend.

550
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,439
When we used to live in Bahawalpur,
we used to visit their house often.

551
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:05,959
Now see, Mr. Shah and his wife couldn’t come
because of something important,

552
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:08,519
they sent their daughter and daughter in law.

553
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,239
You know, Rida had told me
that if my friend doesn’t come,

554
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,280
I will not talk to anyone.

555
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,400
No, no, no. hey, no, no, no.

556
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:30,560
No, please.

557
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,759
Yes, yes papa,

558
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:08,239
I am preparing a lot,

559
00:43:08,439 --> 00:43:10,200
I won’t disappoint you.

560
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:14,319
Why are you jealous?

561
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:18,039
Now if papa has hopes from me,
I am sure he has something in his mind.

562
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,400
That’s it. Stop.

563
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,519
I know well what he would have in his mind.

564
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,439
You two are flatterer,

565
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,319
he is bootlicker number one and
this little one is bootlicker number two.

566
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:32,839
You keep on buttering him.

567
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:35,600
One day will come.

568
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,519
My day will also come.

569
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:42,479
I won’t even ask you two.

570
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:45,600
When will it come brother?

571
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:50,239
Yes, when you will work as
a junior clerk in papa’s office, right?

572
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,759
I don’t want to work as a clerk.

573
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:54,280
This is weird about papa,

574
00:43:54,479 --> 00:43:58,560
the elder son does CSS and
the younger one works as a small time clerk.

575
00:43:58,759 --> 00:43:59,280
Why?

576
00:43:59,759 --> 00:44:02,319
I won’t do it, I will protest.

577
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,079
Yes, the seventeenth grade seat is vacant for you.

578
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:11,000
Those people are waiting since
so long that when Mr. Farhad will come.

579
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:13,800
You two wait, I will fix her today.

580
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:16,839
Yes,

581
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:18,720
you are here,

582
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:20,079
bootlicker number three.

583
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:23,000
Actually people with ordinary thinking,

584
00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:27,280
ordinary people, their mind is
fixed on high positions and grades,

585
00:44:28,479 --> 00:44:30,000
my destination is something else.

586
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,360
Yes, let us hear it, what is your destination.

587
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,879
I will tell you one day,

588
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,920
right now you and Fariha sit and
think about recipes for sauces and jams.

589
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:41,720
Do you see him.

590
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,959
Sallu is here,

591
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:46,800
I am leaving.

592
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,800
Take care of papa.

593
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,759
Brother, why are you leaving?

594
00:44:49,959 --> 00:44:51,959
If papa finds out we will get scolded badly.

595
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:54,839
You handle him, after all, 
you are an expert at flattering.

596
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:57,879
Brother…
Handle him. Okay, fine?

597
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,800
Do you see his actions?

598
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,959
Why do you bother my brother all the time?

599
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:07,360
Its my hobby.

600
00:45:07,759 --> 00:45:09,039
Go make the sauce.

601
00:45:09,439 --> 00:45:12,000
Yes brother, I did meet my friends.

602
00:45:12,879 --> 00:45:14,479
What is the plan of coming back?

603
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,800
You know mama gets sad without you.

604
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,920
It will take a few more days brother, 
a important task has come in the middle.

605
00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:24,000
Important task?

606
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,839
What is the important task?

607
00:45:26,479 --> 00:45:27,600
Is everything okay?

608
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:29,000
Yes, everything is fine.

609
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,479
Give my hello and love to mama
and tell her that I will come soon.

610
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,959
And tell her not make you call me
with excuses to find out how I am.

611
00:45:39,759 --> 00:45:41,759
Fine, I will give her your message.

612
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:45,200
Okay, we will talk later.

613
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,239
Bye.

614
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,000
Sir, the guests are here.

615
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:33,959
Why are you smiling so much?

616
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,400
Faris messaged,

617
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:38,959
he is saying
I cannot spend this time without you.

618
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:43,720
Oh God, your husband’s love filled message.

619
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,439
Man, I think that this mobile is a great invention.

620
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:49,759
I mean,

621
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:50,839
calls,

622
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:51,920
messages,

623
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:53,800
you get to talk immediately.

624
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,479
I feel that some lover invented it,

625
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,600
whose ancestors must have
some lover type person,

626
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:04,159
whose lover would have given her
life by drowning in the sea

627
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,959
because she didn’t get the message on time.

628
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,800
You are the limit, Mahi,
you made a story out of something so trivial.

629
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:15,159
Just like that, give it a thought.

630
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:20,200
What are you doing?

631
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:21,879
Mahi.

632
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,360
Mahi, what are you doing?
I am not allowed to call him.

633
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,479
Papa has told me not to.

634
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,759
Not an issue, papa is not here.

635
00:47:27,959 --> 00:47:29,600
Papa. Papa. See, he is not here.

636
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,920
Yeah, but I am not allowed to call him,
I have also told him not to.

637
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,159
Okay, just for fun.

638
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:37,000
It doesn’t look nice. Mahi, he is calling.

639
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,400
Give it to me. Mahi, give it to me.

640
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,079
No.

641
00:47:40,479 --> 00:47:43,839
Nothing happens, its okay,
a little fun is allowed.

642
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:44,879
Man….

643
00:47:48,439 --> 00:47:49,200
Hello.

644
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,439
Yes, hello.

645
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,959
Who are you?

646
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,600
Who do you want to talk to?

647
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,280
I am sorry I dialed the wrong number.

648
00:48:00,479 --> 00:48:02,600
No, nothing like that,

649
00:48:02,759 --> 00:48:05,360
now that you have dialed the number,

650
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,319
what will you lose talking to me for two minutes.

651
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,680
You know, you have an intoxicating voice.

652
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:16,560
What do they say in English?

653
00:48:17,319 --> 00:48:18,720
Toxic.

654
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,159
Really? No one has told me this earlier.

655
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:28,159
Hey you must not have found someone
as appreciative as me, before.

656
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,920
What do you do?

657
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:33,879
First you tell me, who are you?
And what is your name?

658
00:48:34,479 --> 00:48:40,519
Yes, my name is Suneela Jabeen.
People say that what’s in the work.

659
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:45,200
Suneela Jabeen, wow,
your name is equally intoxicating.

660
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,319
Faris, how dare you? You cheat!

661
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:52,680
How can you talk to my friend like this.

662
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,000
Oh Rida, you.

663
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:58,600
Shut up, Faris,
and don’t call me again, you cheat.

664
00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:04,200
Hey, we can’t do that,
the wedding is fixed, we cannot leave him.

665
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,280
I am sorry, this was funny.

666
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:08,920
So Mr. Taufeeq, how are you?

667
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,079
I am good.

668
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,600
Are you coming from the office?

669
00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:13,959
Yes, I got a little late today.

670
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,720
Mr. Taufeeq, I have told Naheed,

671
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,159
that after today no need to bring
the paper from Mr. Taufeeq’s home daily,

672
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,280
we are getting our own subscription.

673
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,239
The paper has been coming from our home
for the past twenty years,

674
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:30,759
so you can do it for two to four more years.

675
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:36,600
You know, neighbors help neighbors,
even if it is a newspaper worth ten rupees.

676
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,479
Oh yes, I remembered,

677
00:49:38,879 --> 00:49:41,519
I met Mr. Affaq from education
board in the morning.

678
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,319
Yes, he is an examiner in
the education department, right?

679
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:45,680
Yes, the same one.

680
00:49:46,479 --> 00:49:48,720
He was really complaining about Farhad.

681
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,439
What happened?

682
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:57,839
He is the external examiner
at Farhad’s exam center.

683
00:49:58,039 --> 00:49:58,519
Yes.

684
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,239
He was saying that
 he didn’t give any exam.

685
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:04,479
He was really feeling sorry,

686
00:50:04,759 --> 00:50:07,319
that the son of such an educated

687
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,639
and capable father’s son is
so uneducated, so incapable.

688
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:13,319
He will surely fail this time too.

689
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:22,839
He was being sarcastic towards me
for giving me the newspaper for twenty years!

690
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:38,479
Where is he?

691
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:42,200
Sajjad has gone to see where he is,
he must be coming back with him.

692
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,639
Yes, he must be sitting with his loafer,
cheap friends, he must be playing something.

693
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,600
They are here.

694
00:50:56,479 --> 00:50:58,159
Come son, come.

695
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,239
Where were you son?

696
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,920
Papa, I was here with friends.

697
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:06,039
Okay, nothing,

698
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,159
you had your last exam today,

699
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,639
so I wanted to ask about that,
how did it go?

700
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,000
It went well, I had worked hard.

701
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,319
Okay, okay.

702
00:51:15,479 --> 00:51:21,439
Look, should we hope for a first division or
will you give us a bigger happiness than that?

703
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:25,079
Papa, I don’t know about first
or second division,

704
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,959
I have worked hard,

705
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,720
rest is in God’s hands.

706
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:36,879
Oh God.
